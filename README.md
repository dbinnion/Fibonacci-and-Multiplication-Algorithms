# Fibonacci-and-Multiplication-Algorithms

Motivation:

To find faster ways of approaching common problems (many of the Euler Problems use the Fibonacci sequence).

Aim:

Implement faster approaches to the Fibonacci sequence and multiplication.

Use:

Run as found.

Fibonacci:

In order of fastest to slowest: Fibonacci rounding - O(1), Fibonacci doubling - O(logn), Fibonacci Matrix - O(logn).  Other methods can range in speed from O(2^n) to O(n). 

Multiplication:

Karatsuba: O(n^log3) instead of O(n^2) as with regular multiplication.

Exponentiation by doubling: O(logn) instead of O(n)
